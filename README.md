## Implementing an Autonomous FPV Racing Module

### Goal
  1. Getting an idea of classical path planning algorithms used in navigating an unknown environment
    We implemented these 2D algorithms using gui libraries in C++ and Python. This is organized under <a href="https://github.com/AerialRobotics-IITK/fpv_2023/tree/main/simulations_2d">/simulations_2d</a>
  2. Implementing a naive approach of hard-coding positions of the gate, and commanding the UAV to the centre coordinates; which are in turn obtained by classical detection methods. The source code and simulation demo for this can be found under <a href="https://github.com/AerialRobotics-IITK/fpv_2023/tree/main/naive_fpv_simul">/naive_fpv_simul</a>
  3. Implementing an intelligent system to navigate at efficient trajectories. We are re-implementing the approach demonstrated recenetly by UZH - <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06419-4">"Champion-level drone racing using deep reinforcement learning"</a>. We are aiming to mould the approach in order to make it more robust, at the expense of time or efficiency.

### Instructions to Set up the Simulator

We intend to use the open-source flight simulator <a href="https://uzh-rpg.github.io/flightmare/">**flighmare**</a> which has built-in reinforcement learning toolchain. Installation instructions can be found in their <a href="Installation instructions can be found in our Wiki">Wiki</a> 

#### Troubleshooting while installing flightmare
- 
  ```
  Error: Couldnâ€™t build wheel for opencv-python 
  ```
  **Build opencv-python independently (https://github.com/opencv/opencv-python). In ``setup.py`` comment the following lines:** <br>
    -  ``if sys.version_info >= (3, 6):
      rearrange_cmake_output_data["cv2.typing"] = ["python/cv2" + r"/typing/.*\.py"]``
    - `` [ r"python/cv2/py.typed" ] if sys.version_info >= (3, 6) else []``

- 
  ```
  conda: error: argument COMMAND: invalid choice: 'activate'
  ```
  **Try running ``source activate <env_name>``**

-
  ```
  ERROR: Failed building wheel for flightgym
  CMake Error at googletest-download/googletest-prefix/tmp/googletest-gitclone.cmake:40 (message): Failed to checkout tag: 'master'
  ```  
  **Change ``GIT_TAG`` from ``master`` to ``main`` in ``flightlib/cmake/gtest_download.cmake``**
